# pythongames

I'm new to programming and Python is my first language I'm learning. I've used online self-learning resources to get started. To start coding I've had a go at making some simple games. I've used tutorials for a bit of a head start but I do like to change them slightly to start being more creative. It's baby steps for now as I can't do everything I'd like to. I'm more interested in understanding why and grasping the fundamentals. I might be in a hurry to learn but I don't want to cut corners as I know that will trip me up later.
